abstract: "With abundant observation in the real world, it is easy for human to infer the stereo-structure with only a single view of an object. Is it possible for a model to acquire such ability without long-lasting training? It is promising that without the expensive 3D shape annotation, we can simply profit from the synthetic data, where pairwise ground-truth is easy to obtain. Nevertheless, the domain gap is not neglectable within the variant texture, shape and context. For the sake of overcoming such complexity, we propose a domain-adaptive network for 3D reconstruction, named LMM, to improve the generalization towards the natural scenario by fulfilling several aspects: (1) Look: enhancing the representation extracted from the single-view image by incorporating a Non-local Structured Attention module; (2) Map: leveraging the semantic information with unsupervised contrastive mapping for narrowing the domain gap with the knowledge priors; (3) Mold: recovering the elaborated representation into the desired stereo space with discernment and deep-set knowledge. Extensive experiments on several benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method, LMM, in learning the 3D shape manifold from only a single-view image.
