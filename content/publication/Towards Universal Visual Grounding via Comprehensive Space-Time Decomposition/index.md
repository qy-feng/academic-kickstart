abstract: "Visual grounding in videos is one of the most challenging tasks in vision-language understanding due to the diversity in the spatial composition as well as the temporal variation. Current practices concentrate mostly on performing visual grounding in static images or well-trimmed video clips. Differently, this work investigates into a general setting, e.g, untrimmed videos, which is more challenging yet practical in real-world applications. To facilitate the research of visual grounding in such a general paradigm, we elaborate a new Universal Visual Grounding (UVG) dataset, including far-ranging videos with large diversity in space and time. Besides, we propose a simple yet effective approach, named Dual Pointer Network (DP-Net), to better cope with complex corner cases by decomposing the representations of spatial context and temporal motion, and aligning them separately with the referring expression. Additionally, we further present a contrastive learning strategy to enhance the consistence of the learned representation across space and time. Extensive experiments well demonstrate the superiority of the proposed DP-Net over strong baseline methods. Code and dataset will be made available.
